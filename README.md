-A new Flutter project.
+Snap a photo, unlock its story! ProductLens AI uses the power of Google's Gemini AI directly within a Flutter application to identify any product or non-living object from an image. Get instant insights including a **title**, a **detailed description**, and a **fun fact** to pique your curiosity!
 
 ## Getting Started
 
-This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
+This project is a Flutter application showcasing the integration of cutting-edge AI for image recognition and information retrieval.
+
+### ðŸ¤” What it does:
+
+- **Snap & Identify:** Take a picture of virtually any product or object.
+- **AI-Powered Insights:** Leverages Google's Gemini AI to analyze the image.
+- **Instant Information:** Receives a concise `title`, an informative `description`, and an engaging `fun_fact` about the identified item.
